# Library-TOP  
Project created during The Odin Project course (TOP) 
The goal was to create a wirtual library for books that you want to read or you just did it.  
There were some requirements. User should be able to add new books to the library by clicking a button. In my version there is a popout dialog that appears in the center of the screen with form that have to be filled and checkbox if the book has been read.  
Every added book displays in the library and can be easly removed by "remove" button.  
There is always a chance to chec or uncheck the checkbox.  
I added some images so the library looks a little bit cosy. I added also some flexibility so the library stay in the same shape if the screen is smaller and it can adjust if it is bigger.  
For now there were no requirements to store the users input so every reload library is empty.  
Every clipart in this project is from https://pngtree.com/.
